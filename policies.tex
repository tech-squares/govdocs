\policy{Adopting and Amending Standing Policies}
\label{pol:adopt}
\sptimes{Spring 2015}{Fall 2018}
\section{}Standing policies may be adopted or amended by majority vote of the club. Proposed policies or amendments must be submitted to the club at least two weeks prior to being voted on. Changes to the amendments can be made during those two weeks, including at the meeting, so long as the changes preserve the essential nature of the amendment.
\section{}Standing policies may be adopted or amended by majority vote of the EC. The EC shall inform the club of any such changes it makes to the standing policies, and no changes shall take effect until two weeks after said notification. Upon petition by five voting members of the club, or majority vote of the EC, any EC change shall be delayed until addressed at a club meeting. Alternatively, the EC may choose to discard any change rather than bringing it to club vote.
\section{}Each standing policy shall have a date by which it will be reviewed. Unless otherwise specified, policies shall be reviewed by the end of the third fall semester after adoption or re-approval.
\section{}For each standing policy, early in the semester when it will be reviewed, the EC shall publicize and hold an open EC meeting to discuss the policy and any needed amendments. The EC shall decide whether to re-approve it (possibly with amendments), remove it, or refer it to the club for further discussion.


\policy{Club Level}
\sptimes{Spring 2015}{Fall 2020}
\section{}The club level shall be the \textsc{Callerlab} Plus program.


\policy{Membership}
\sptimes{Spring 2015}{Fall 2020}

\section{}At its discretion, the Executive Committee may grant membership to prospective members outside the class process. Such prospective members must dance club level proficiently and have attended at least four of fifteen consecutive weekly dances.
\section{}Club membership does not expire, though a club member may relinquish membership, and membership may be revoked per \ref{pol:safer}.
